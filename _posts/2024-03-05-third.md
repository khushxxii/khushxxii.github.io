In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a basic client-server architecture using Python and Node.js. We'll create a simple server in Node.js that listens for incoming requests and responds with a message, and a client in Python that sends requests to the server and displays the response.

**1. Setting Up the Server (Node.js)**

First, let's create a simple Node.js server that listens for HTTP requests and responds with a message. Create a file named `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello from the server!');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Save the file, and then run the server using the command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server and make it listen for incoming requests on port 3000.

**2. Creating the Client (Python)**

Next, let's create a Python script to act as the client. We'll use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the server. Create a file named `client.py` and add the following code:

```python
import requests

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'

try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Server Response:", response.text)
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data from the server. Status code:", response.status_code)
except requests.RequestException as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

Save the file, and then run the client using the command:

```bash
python client.py
```

This will send a GET request to the server, and the client will display the server's response.

**3. Sending Messages Between Client and Server**

Now that we have the server and client set up, let's modify them to exchange simple messages. We'll update the server to accept POST requests with a message in the request body, and we'll update the client to send a message to the server.

Modify the server code (`server.js`) as follows:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/') {
    let body = '';
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk.toString();
    });
    req.on('end', () => {
      const message = JSON.parse(body);
      res.statusCode = 200;
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      res.end(JSON.stringify({ response: `Message received: ${message.text}` }));
    });
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end('Not found');
  }
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

This updated server code now accepts POST requests with a message in the request body. It parses the message and responds with a JSON object containing the received message.

Next, modify the client code (`client.py`) as follows:

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'

message = {'text': 'Hello from the client!'}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(message), headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print("Server Response:", data['response'])
    else:
        print("Failed to send message to the server. Status code:", response.status_code)
except requests.RequestException as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

This updated client code sends a POST request with a JSON message to the server. It then displays the response received from the server.

That's it! You've now built a simple client-server architecture using Python and Node.js. You can further extend this example by adding error handling, implementing different types of requests, or adding additional functionality to the server and client.
